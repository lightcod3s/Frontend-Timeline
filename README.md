## Overview

In this project, I participated in the challenge of building a responsive QR code web page using only HTML and CSS. The goal was to implement a clean, accessible layout and interactions relying solely on semantic, structural HTML markup and styling capabilities of custom CSS properties and flexbox.

I took advantage of native HTML5 elements like main and div elements to provide an accessible document structure and experience, without needing to reach for any JavaScript. For the visual design and interactions, I used CSS features like custom properties for easy global theming, media queries and percentages for responsiveness across device sizes, and flexbox for a robust and flexible layout.

I focused on markup best practices and sharpen my responsive CSS skills. Troubleshooting layout issues and browser inconsistencies also made me far more comfortable digging into developer tools to tweak, iterate, and refine my CSS.  

Overall this project gave me valuable practice structuring, styling and prototyping a common site layout with HTML and CSS alone before needing to add any interactivity later. The techniques and confidence I built make me feel much more equipped to tackle the frontend and styling aspects for any web project moving forward.

### What I learned

Building this responsive QR code page taught me a ton about modern frontend work. I tried my best in using semantic HTML5 markup to structure the content, and made use of elements like <main> and <dIV>.

For styling, I was able to find my footing in CSS using custom properties to avoid repetition, and flexbox to create a super flexible layout. Getting the sizing and alignment dialed on mobile, tablet, and desktop views took some doing but was great responsive practice.

And through plenty of debugging, I got way more comfortable analyzing CSS issues in dev tools to squash bugs. By the end, I felt right at home navigating the elements panel and testing different breakpoints.

Most importantly, I also built up more confidence for structuring sites using clean, flexible HTML and CSS. The combo of modern markup patterns with utility-focused styling like custom properties and flexbox feels really powerful!

I also picked up on learning how to push projects to github.It was a little bit confusing at first but I got the hang of it. Kudos to 


### Continued development

Some areas I would continue to focus on include Flex box and CSS custom properties. They were a bit challenging because of CSS order of hierachy for various elements.

It was simple and easy to follow. I'd recommend it to anyone trying to push their projects to github for the first time.
